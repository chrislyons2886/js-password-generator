# js-password-generator

## Description

For this project, I was given starter code for a javascript based randomized password generator.  The objective was to create a final product that presented a series of prompts for password criteria, allowed users to select which criteria to include in the password, and how many characters they wanted their password to be.  When all criteria are met and the button is clicked, the user is given a new randomized password made up of the character options they selected.  This project was completed by using a variety of javascript code, including variables, arrays, functions, if statements, event listeners, foor loops, and more.
